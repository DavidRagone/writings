I've been thinking recently about the motivations that keep me in - or drive me away - from working at a particular company. There's three distinct (more or less) concepts I think about, conciously or otherwise.

## Giving

It's incredibly important to me to feel that I am meaningfully contributing to the product, business, and organization (that strange combination of humans working together). That in and of itself requires quite a lot. The business needs to have a clear direction and strategy, communicated to the org clearly and regularly, believed and shared by everyone. There needs to be a product strategy - what differentiates what we're building from the rest of the market (aka, positioning) - and vision. The organization needs shared values and norms, and needs to value diversity at its core.

That's a lot to ask, and I'm happy to contribute to create the environment I need to thrive. The core principle here is simply that I need to be adding to everything around me and making things better, whether that be what we're building (product), how we build it (process), or who is building it (people). When I feel that I'm simply spinning my wheels, and either the work isn't moving the product, business, or organization forward (which can happen when there's no common sense of what forward means), I lose motivation quickly.


## Taking

When pithfully expressed in a word like the heading above, this motivation sounds incredibly selfish. A less pithy (and hopefully less selfish sounding) version goes like this: I am motivated when I am stretching beyond my comfort zone, while being supported by those around me. An organization that doesn't expect people to grow into new challenges, or doesn't appreciate the value and need for training, coaching, and helping is one that is (in my opinion) failing its people.

To some degree, much of this can be covered by being driven and personally responsible for fulfilling needs. Early stage companies aren't going to have the in-house resources, so one needs to develop a mentorship network and find support elsewhere. But even small organizations can recognize this need, and contribute towards helping their employees grow.

This is an expectation I have for those who report to me as much as for myself. An organization (and the managers within) owes as much to the people working there as they do to it; employment is a contract of growth for the individual as much as for the company.


## Winning

It doesn't need to (and often shouldn't) come easy, and certainly doesn't mean we need to win every battle, but a fruitless struggle is incredibly de-motivating. In large part, this should be a result of (and the feedback loop for) the first two concepts; when done well, and given the right conditions and enough luck, it's not unreasonable to expect to see enough wins and feel a sense of progress. 


----------------------------------

I doubt this is the only way I could think about my motivations, but this seems to be the framework I come back to most often. I think it likely informs much of my general assumptions around interacting with those around me and managing the engineers who report to me.
