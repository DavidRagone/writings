# Balance

An ad from Apple has some interesting ideas on how to live life:

I originally saw this on [twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/jasonfried/status/873174201129205761)

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised seeing such things from Apple (the company building a campus with everything but a daycare), but I still can't believe this ad. It reminds me of an interesting discussion I had with a former manager about what and how we celebrate wins, and how that defines our culture and norms. 

I'm sure everyone has made sacrifices to accomplish something. Deciding trade offs between different approaches is a core part of not just software engineering, but also of life. I've certainly made choices that have hurt relationships, some goals, and my short term happiness in favor of an expected long-term payoff. 

But when a company decides to celebrate the effort ("we really appreciate how Bob worked late into the night and over the weekend to get this done"), it sets the boundaries for defining success. It becomes not about the accomplishment, but the sacrifice made to get there. Effort should be appreciated, but highlighting company-wide sets expectations for everyone else, and define a value of personal sacrifice for group gain. I know there are some companies (and industries) that are perfectly fine with this, but I'm not interested in being a part of them. I believe that people can create something amazing while also having reasonable boundaries that allow them to be well-rounded. This is a fundamental belief I inherited from the Jesuits, and I am greatly for their influence on me here.
