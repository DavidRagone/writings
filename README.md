# writings

I've had a few different blogs, and haven't loved any of them. I keep thinking I'll set something up, but not having a go-to, public-facing place to host my writing means I don't write. 

For now, I'll write here (the github UI is good enough for some simple markdown posts), and figure out what to do with all the words later.
