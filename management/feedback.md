## On Giving Feedback

### Inspiration

On Twitter, I came across these two tweets:

> If you have a manager who will give you hard feedback about your work and yet also have your back, stick with them. Seems like most won't.

> Too often managers will give you comfortable excuses for why you're not advancing, and avoid harder topics. You won't grow that way.

To which I responded:

> There's so much in this to unpack. Need to really understand their work, have hard conversations, prove have their back. Manage up as well

It seems like the original source was a talk by [@JillWetzler](https://mobile.twitter.com/JillWetzler/status/874379072943648768) (I'd like to find this talk to watch it, but have failed to do so in my brief search).


### Setting the stage

I think a lot of this is about expectation setting. In order for feedback to be received well, my engineers need to know that they should (a) expect to receive feedback regularly from me (and hold me to that), (b) know that I have their back as they work to improve. This feels like it needs to be part of the early 1-1's. I think it could be worth diving into feedback they've received in the past, using specific examples to understand how they received it, how they responded, what they would have changed about both parts of that in the future, and using that experience to inform how I share feedback and have hard conversations with them.

### Following through

Taking a page from Getting Things Done, I'm starting to do a monthly (though perhaps it should be every sprint) review of each of my engineer's work to see what feedback I have for them. If there's nothing there, then I'm not doing my job by being sufficiently in the loop to see how they're doing - I'll need to sit in on their meetings, check out their code and PRs they put up, and just generally be present for them so I can provide that perspective. I feel that a lot of helping people improve (which is the thing that makes me love managing) is in being that mirror + duck; not all, but some of these hard conversations feel hard because they've been trying to ignore what they know is true, and I'm forcing them to acknowledge and work through it. If I didn't do that early enough, it's likely they've developed a narrative to help them believe they're right, even when they know deep down they're wrong or can do better; digging that narrative out is what's hard.

### More to come

I'm still thinking through a lot of this. I'll come back to this in the future.
