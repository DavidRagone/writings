## What I tell great engineers who say "I think I want to be a manager"

> For the love of all that is good in the world, don't.  

But seriously, how would you feel about:

* Not writing code, ever
* Not making any technical decisions
* Spending most of every day in meetings
* Being part time bureaucrat, part time therapist

> Take the next few days and think about it. Think about why you feel this is a path you want, and what you'll give up. Let's chat next week

... next week ...

> Still want to manage?

Put your toes in the water:

* You'll be running our retro. Think about what the team needs, and choose from one of the formats we've run in the past, or, even better, come up with a new format that helps the team move in the direction they need (this requires having your pulse on the team, gathering info, and seeding the right ideas). As you're running it, think about what it means to represent the team, and what impact that role has on what you can and can't say
* Reach out to the junior engineers across the company and schedule 1-1's with them. Let them know you'd love to hear about their experience so far. Figure out what we need to change, and then get them to want to (and successfully) enact that change.
* You're going to run our next planning meeting. Make sure you take the time beforehand to get up to speed on all the projects (especially the ones you're not intimately familiar with), and understand what we're trying to accomplish, both for the project and in this next sprint. Reach out to the engineers, designers, and PMs as needed to get up to speed

... a few weeks later (and after each of those experiences) ...

> So how'd that go? Tell me what you were thinking? How did you feel differently than as an IC in those situations? What did you learn?
