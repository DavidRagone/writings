## My writings on management

* [On giving hard feedback](feedback.md)

## My path here

I moved into an engineering management role while working as a full-stack (web) developer at [Hired](https://hired.com). Just like programming, the only way to get better at managing is to work at it. While the feedback loops are much slower (it's not quite as straightforward as red-green-refactor), the big picture stays the same: read, write, talk to people. 

This is where I'm tracking my personal endeavor to be a better management. I'll list what I plan to read, whether that be blog posts or books that I haven't found the time for, and what I plan to write in more detail about (where I'll write is still a bit tbd).

Please feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/badatreality).

## Things I've enjoyed reading (and some notes / quotes)

### [RethinkDB's The effective engineer’s handbook](http://www.defmacro.org/2013/03/10/effective-handbook.html)

> The single biggest mistake brilliant engineers make is to work on things that don’t make the slightest bit of difference in the grand scheme of things. ... The reason why brilliant people make this mistake so often is that it’s easy to confuse the set of difficult problems with the set of useful ones. ... The best way to learn is to keep asking us until our mental models converge.

> The most common reason for being unable to ship high quality software quickly is over-engineering. ... It’s a very human quality to anticipate tomorrow’s problems and solve them today. The reason why it’s particularly dangerous in software engineering is that there is a mountain of empirical evidence that humans are very poor predictors of problems in software projects. ... In my time here I almost never encountered opposition when I asked people to work on something, but I used to almost always encounter opposition when I asked them not to work on something. But in fact, people should do the exact opposite.

> Occasionally I walk around the office, asking people to explain in depth how they designed the components they’re working on. ... When we started out, every time I did the walkthrough, I inevitably discovered that almost everyone had very different mental models of fairly important aspects of the system. ... A few weeks into your time here you should have a good understanding of the company, the product, and its architecture. This means for the first two weeks you should spend at least a quarter of your time asking questions. 

> Learning to be sensitive to how the rest of the team feels, and how your individual behavior affects everyone else is crucial to being effective. ... If you aren’t an extrovert, we don’t expect you to act like one. But we do expect you to inspire the team with the quality of your work, your kindness, and your energy. Being effective means increasing the overall output of the team by much more than your individual contributions. It’s not enough to be good – you also have to make others around you better.

## Topics I plan/want to write about

* Code reviews
* 1-on-1's
* Performance reviews
* How to provide hard feedback, and when (hint: asap)
* When someone joins the team (first x days)
* When joining a new team (as an IC)
* When joining a new team (as an EM)
* Transitioning to management: Congrats, you no longer get to solve the (fun) problems. Now your job is about defining the problem, making sure the team sees the connection form the problem to the goal, and enabling them to succeed.
* Team culture
* Using us-vs-them: building your team by defining "other". See IBM's Black Team (their other was the engineers whose hard work they aimed to crush)
* Fighting us-vs-them: building cross-functional and cross-team collaboration, reducing barriers
* How to push your team to do its best work
