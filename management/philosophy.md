## What's my management philosophy?

This is a question I've seen in many places. It's easy to spend my time as a manager putting out fires and running from one meeting to the next, while not stepping back to think about what central beliefs are driving my decisions and responses.

I don't think I've got a succinct way to define my philosophy yet. I'll work on the pithy catchphrase later. For now, here's some bullet points:

* I aim to be self-aware, authentic, and humble, and push those around me to be the same
* Context matters. This means that I care to know what makes you you and what's going on in your life, but also that you need to know what's going on in the business to feel truly connected to your work
* Engineering, to me, is about being a solution expert **and** about being able to dive into a problem-space to map the two. **That** is ultimately our job - mapping problem space to solution space.
* I often qualify my statements, because I don't believe in black-and-white (this goes back, in part, to context mattering). Engineering is about trade-offs
* I want to make it possible for everyone around me to do the best work of their lives. To do that, I try to know as much as I can about what they've done, where they think they might go, and what they can do to grow
* I love the idea of servant leadership; I work for my team, facilitating the relationship between each employee and the organization. My focus is on what it takes for them to be successful
