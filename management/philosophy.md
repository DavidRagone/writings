## What's my management philosophy?

Make it possible for people to do the best work of their lives.

Giving tools, enabling, giving environment. Autonomy, mastery, purpose. Freedom to make decision, big vision to chase after, let them get better at their jobs. Always raise the bar, make great team excellent, then even better.

Engineers want the room to grow.
